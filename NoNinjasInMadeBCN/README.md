#NoNinjas motion-detection system with RCWL-0516, ESP8266, and MQTT

This project is aimed at detecting when there are members active in our makerspace. This helps let others know when the space is open, as well as giving us a way to quantify and visualize the frequency of activity in different areas of the space. 

We will begin by testing the range of the RCWL-0516 sensor.

Using [this tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-and-node-red-with-mqtt/) as a guide, we will set up some ESP8266 nodes around the space which will communicate with a Raspberry Pi using MQTT (Node Red)
